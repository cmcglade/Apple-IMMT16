			<h2>Who's this guy?</h2>
			<p>Adriano is a 24 year old who often daydreams about becoming a writer someday but never finishes anything. Born and raised in Manaus, Brazil, he graduated in journalism at Devry Martha Falc√£o in 2014, not knowing what he was going to do next. Despite not feeling quite at home as a journalist as he had anticipated, it was during this course that he met his future wife, and a year after graduating they started working towards studying abroad. Sure enough, in September 2016, a month after getting married, they packed their bags and flew into the great (moderately) unknown.</p>
			<h2>What is he up to?</h2>
			<p>Currently, he's working towards a post graduation degree on Interactive Media Management at Centennial College. He's looking forward to a change of carreer, with his main current interest being web and game design. Appart from that, Adriano has amassed an interesting collection of interests through the years. He is passionate towards science and language, and is a gamer at heart. He also likes to think he has potential as a writer.</p>
