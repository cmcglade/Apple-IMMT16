<head><!--femi the assignment was very specifically to code an image gallery using either the jquery code we learned in class or the bootstrap classes we learned in class. The assignment also specified that you use photos you took yourself.  I can only assume also that because you are including two css files and two javascript files but only linking to one css and one javascript file that you did not write the  code yourself.  It's not ok to use someone else's code for your assignments, it is plagiarism.-->
